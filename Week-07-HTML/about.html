    Born and raised in Ghana, West Africa. Well travelled and educated with a degree in Business Management. 
    I am a trained Chef and have worked as Sous Chef for over a decade. 
    I love food, making people happy through food and good times!
    I've always been cooking. I was raised in the kitchen and it was my passion from the very beginning.
    I was always by my mother's side, trying to help make dinner or lunch. 
    Now, because of her inspiration, I'm a nationally recognized chef with my own culinary company.

    I love good food and funky recipes. My idea of a perfect meal is anything with a good combination of veggies, proteins and carbs. 
    I am currently an Executive Chef in the Royal Air Force, supplying food for our brave service personnel.
    I came to America at 12 years old, and I could never imagine that I would accomplish a dream of opening my own restaurant.
    I never thought I'd make a career out of cooking but now I'm here and I'm loving it. 
    Everything from your favorite soul food, to new concepts. Follow me for some good eats.
